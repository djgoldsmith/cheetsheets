  - Click new issues
  - Give an new issue and title.
  - Complete the issue details.

** TODO What makes a poor bug report:
- 'Code does not work'
- 'I cant do X'
- 'Does not compile'

** TODO What makes a good issue:
A clear description of the problem will help developers create a fix.



* Branches
Give us a way to structure how we work on different parts of the repostory at the same time.
And example of this would be the following branch structue:

 - master (the 'stable' codebase
 - development (where development takes place)
   - Feature Branches

** Creating Branches in github
- Click drop down tht says branch:master at the top of the filelist
- Type a new branch name
